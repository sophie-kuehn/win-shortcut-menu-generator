## Windows Shortcut Menu Generator

This is a quick and dirty batch script to automatically build a shortcut directory for a collection of portable apps.

## Explanation and Howto

- copy **settings.cfg.dist** to **settings.cfg** and edit it
- all sub-directories of **appDir** will be scanned for **taskMenu.cfg** files
- the **taskMenu.cfg** should contain one or more lines of link definitions "name to display:relative\path\executable.exe"
- all links will be generated in the **menuDir**
- you may add the **menuDir** now in your task bar and trigger the script on demand
